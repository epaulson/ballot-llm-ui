I am proofreading a ballot before it goes to print. I need you to carefully examine the attached ballot image and compare the candidate names shown on the ballot with the official candidate list I'm providing below.

Official Contest and Candidate Data:
{contest_text}

Please:
1. Read all candidate names from the ballot image
2. Compare each name against the official list above
3. Report any spelling discrepancies, typos, or formatting differences
4. Note your confidence level for each finding (high/medium/low)
5. Specify the exact contest and candidate where you found issues
6. Be very careful about similar names and minor variations

Focus specifically on:
- Misspelled candidate names
- Missing or extra letters
- Wrong capitalization
- Formatting inconsistencies
- Names that don't match the official list

The ballot is laid out in three columns, read top to bottom and then left to right. Please be systematic in your comparison.

Optionally, you may provide your findings in this structured format at the end:
-- BEGIN STRUCTURED OUTPUT --
findings:
  spelling_errors: []
  other_issues: []
summary: "No spelling errors detected. All candidate names match the official list."
analysis_status: "no_issues_found"
-- END STRUCTURED OUTPUT --

If you do find issues, use this format instead:
-- BEGIN STRUCTURED OUTPUT --
findings:
  spelling_errors:
    - description: "[specific description of the spelling error]"
      candidate_found: "[name as it appears on ballot]"
      candidate_expected: "[correct name from official list]"
      contest: "[contest name]"
      confidence: "high/medium/low"
  other_issues:
    - description: "[description of other issue]"
      type: "[formatting/layout/other]"
summary: "[brief summary of findings]"
analysis_status: "completed"
-- END STRUCTURED OUTPUT --
